# Manufacturing-Operations-Performance-Analysis
I tried to make PowerBI dashboard on dummy manufacturing industry data provided by digiXLT consulting company.  I used six main pillars to evaluate this data.

The evaluation includes 
1) Production Overview
2) Quality Overview
3) Production Efficiency
4) Machine Performance
5) Worker Efficiency along with their correlation with production.
6) Rankings of Machines, Workers, Parts based on different components

I am very thankful to Amit Saluja Sir for providing this opportunities. I am very greatful sir.
